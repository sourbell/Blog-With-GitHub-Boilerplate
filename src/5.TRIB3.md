TRIB3 Questions 20200107

1. Accurofit added the integration of weight with  Apple Health and Google Fit, but TRIB3 does not have scale features, so should we remove the data integration section on the MORE page?
2. The Badge(500 Titan) on the Home page and Profile page represents workout amount only? Is there any lowest standard for the workouts? for example, has to be more than 20 minutes or so.
3. TRIB3 is using HRM only, probably low cost LYNK2 later, do we need to remove the LYNK2, SLICE and FUSE from the DEVICE PAIRING page?
4. On DETAILS page, if user choose daily view, and time spent on SWEAT is more than 15 minutes, there will be an badge icon on the graph, but this may not work well, because the height of this SWEAT zone is not static, it is calculated relatively by all four bar, for example, time spent on four zone is 1:00, 120:00, 15:00, 10:00, then the height of SWEAT zone will be only 1/8 of PUSH zone, there will not be enought space for the badge.
5. Continue with this badge, daily view, if i do two workouts, 10 SWEAT minutes from each workout, so it's 20 minutes in total, shoud i display the badge?
6. Continue with the badge, this badge never show up on weekly, monthly or yearly view, correct?
7. If (only if) TRIB3 is using LYNK2, the calories will update even if user doesn't do any workout, should we only  count the workout calories?
8. Missing forgot password pages (see attachments)
9. On WORKOUT HISTORY page, when you click on a workout, the app will display the workout detail, currently the detail is displaying on the same page, while in Accurofit we display this in a new Modal page, which i believe is more user friendly.
10. `TRIB3` was  taken on AppStore, we should come with another one.
