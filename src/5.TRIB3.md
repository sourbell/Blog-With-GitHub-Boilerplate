TRIB3 Questions 20200107

1. Accurofit added weight integration with Apple Health and Google Fit, but TRIB3 does not have scale features, so should we remove the data integration section on the MORE page?
2. The Badge(500 Titan) on the HOME page and PROFILE page represents workout amount only? Is there any lowest standard for the workouts? for example, has to be more than 20 minutes or so.
3. TRIB3 is using HRM only, probably low cost LYNK2 later, do we need to remove the LYNK2, SLICE and FUSE from the DEVICE PAIRING page?
4. On DETAILS page, if user choose daily view, and time spent on SWEAT is more than 15 minutes, there will be a badge icon on the SWEAT zone graph, but this may not work well, because the height of the SWEAT zone is not a static value, it is calculated relatively by all four zone bar, for example, time spent on four zones are 1:00, 120:00, 15:00, 10:00, the height of SWEAT zone will be only 1/8 of PUSH zone, there will not be enought space for the badge icon.
5. Continue with the badge, daily view, if user does two workouts in one day, 10 SWEAT minutes from each workout, so it's 20 minutes in total, shoud i display the badge?
6. Continue with the badge, this badge never show up on weekly, monthly or yearly view, correct?
7. If (only if) TRIB3 is using LYNK2, the calories will update even if user doesn't do any workout, should we only count the workout calories?
8. Missed FORGOT PASSWORD pages (see attachment)
9. On WORKOUT HISTORY page, when you click on a workout, the app will display the workout detail, currently the detail is displaying on the same page, while in Accurofit we display this in a new modal page on top of the HISTORY page, which i think is more user friendly.
10. `TRIB3` was taken on AppStore, we should come up with another one.
