Is there any lowest standard for the workouts? for example, has to be more than 20 minutes or so.\nTRIB3 is using HRM only, probably low cost LYNK2 later, do we need to remove the LYNK2, SLICE and FUSE from the DEVICE PAIRING page?\nOn DETAILS page, if user choose daily view, and time spent on SWEAT is more than 15 minutes, there will be a badge icon on the SWEAT zone graph, but this may not work well, because the height of the SWEAT zone is not a static value, it is calculated relatively by all four zone bar, for example, time spent on four zones are 1:00, 120:00, 15:00, 10:00, the height of SWEAT zone will be only 1/8 of PUSH zone, there will not be enought space for the badge icon.\nContinue with the badge, daily view, if user does two workouts in one day, 10 SWEAT minutes from each workout, so it's 20 minutes in total, shoud i display the badge?\nContinue with the badge, this badge never show up on weekly, monthly or yearly view, correct?\nIf (only if) TRIB3 is using LYNK2, the calories will update even if user doesn't do any workout, should we only count the workout calories?\nMissed FORGOT PASSWORD pages (see attachment)\nOn WORKOUT HISTORY page, when you click on a workout, the app will display the workout detail, currently the detail is displaying on the same page, while in Accurofit we display this in a new modal page on top of the HISTORY page, which i think is more user friendly.\nTRIB3 was taken on AppStore, we should come up with another one.\n\n", "categories": [{"name": "Project Manage", "slug": "Project Manage", "permalink": "https://project.sourbell.im/category/Project Manage/"}], "tags": [{"name": "Project Manage", "slug": "Project Manage", "permalink": "https://project.sourbell.im/tag/Project Manage/"}, {"name": "Private Label", "slug": "Private Label", "permalink": "https://project.sourbell.im/tag/Private Label/"}]}, {"title": "Private Label Update", "date": "2020-01-07T12:42:00-00.00", "path": "https://project.sourbell.im/archives/private-label-update/", "text": "2020.2.4\n\nHIIT80 v1.0.3 waiting for review on GooglePlay and AppStore.\nChanged name from HIITPH to HIIT80Heart\n\n\nCrunch v1.0.0 removed from AppStore and GooglePlay.\n\n\n2020.2.3\n\nWork Horse Gym v1.0.0 is live on GooglePlay and AppStore.\nFreestyle Fitness v2.0.2 is live on GooglePlay and AppStore.\nfixed background music issue.\nopen up to all HRMs.\n\n\nCheckmate HR v1.0.0 is live on GooglePlay and AppStore.\n\n\n2020.1.25\n\nTonic Crossfit v1.0.2 is live on GooglePlay and AppStore.\n\n\n2020.1.8\n\nAll Heart Boxing v1.0.0 waiting for review on GooglePlay and AppStore.\nTX Thailand v1.0.0 pre-released on FIR.IM.\n\n\n2020.1.7\n\nMomentum Fitness v1.0.0 pre-released on FIR.IM.\nImpact Strong Elite v1.0.0 pre-released on FIR.IM.\nAll Heart Boxing v1.0.0 pre-released on FIR.IM.\n\n\n2020.1.6\n\nWolfpack Fitness &amp; MMA v1.0.0 pre-released on FIR.IM.\n\n\n2020.1.4\n\nWV Fitness HR v1.0.1 is live on AppStore annd GooglePlay, with new changes applied:\n1, Change app name from WV Fitness to WV Fitness HR.\n\n\n\n\n2019.12.24\n\nRN Heart Rate v1.0.1 is live on AppStore.\nAF Heart Rate v1.0.1 is live  on AppStore.\nSuburban Fitness v1.0.0 is live on AppStore\u3002\nHIIT80 v1.0.1 is live on AppStore.\n4K Fitness v1.0.0 pre-released on FIR.IM\nRoden HIIT Kickboxing v1.0.0 pre-released on FIR.IM\n\n\n2019.12.22\n\nInnovative Kickboxing v1.0.0 is live on AppStore\nHIIT80 v1.0.1 is live on GooglePlay and waiting for review on AppStore, with new changes applied:\n1, Change Int.
